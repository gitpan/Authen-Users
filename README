ABSTRACT

Local DBI based user password authentication

DESCRIPTION

General password authentication using DBI-capable databases. Currently supports
MySQL and SQLite databases. The default is to use a SQLite database to store 
and access user information. 

This module is not an authentication protocol. For that see something such as
Authen::AuthenDBI.

SYNOPSIS

use Authen::Users;

my $authen = new Athen::Users(dbtype => 'SQLite', dbname => 'mydbname');

my $a_ok = $authen->authenticate($group, $user, $password);

my $result = $authen->add_user(
	$group, $user, $password, $fullname, $email, $question, $answer);
